Project 2 by Kyle and Neer

How to compile parts one and 2:

Go into folder labeled "phase 1" or "phase 2" then run "make". The result will be the .ko
files for each phase. Then just "sudo insmod [NAME]".

To test, go into each phase's Test/ folder, run make, and run the executable.

All outputs required are the .txt files.
